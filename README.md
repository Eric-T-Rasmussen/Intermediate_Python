# Intermediate_Python
I took an intermediate Python course to learn the language for use in machine learning applications. Take a look at some of the stuff I worked on!

Final Project:
Using a combination of web scrapping and information gathered via JSON queries, our team created an interactive code that can give the environmental safety condition information of any county/zip code in america. I personally wrote the water safety section. Try it out!
